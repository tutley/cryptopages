        <p class="body-2">
          This website started from a simple idea: what if Crypto-enthusiasts wanted to do business with other crypto-enthusiasts and pay each other using their favorte cryptocurrencies?
        </p>
        <p class="body-1">
          Also, it started because I wanted to learn <a href="https://goa.design">goa</a>, so I <a href="https://github.com/tutley/cryptopages">setup this API in a weekend</a>, and took a few more weeks to get the front end working, and here we are.

        If you want to participate in our little c2c yellow pages (crypto-to-crytpo) then just sign up and create an account. Once you have an account, you can search through the listings and see what's out there. Have fun!
